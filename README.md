# Colonoscopy Image Analysis with UNet
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of colonoscopy images using the UNet architecture for both classification and segmentation tasks.

## Tasks

1. **Classification:**
   - Trained a Resnet model for classifying colonoscopy images into different categories.
   - Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between various classes, contributing to improved diagnostic capabilities.

2. **Segmentation:**
   - Implemented UNet for semantic segmentation of colon regions in the images.
   - Generated precise masks highlighting the colon structures, aiding in detailed analysis and pathology detection.
